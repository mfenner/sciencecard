ScienceCard started as a web service that collects Article-Level Metrics for scientific articles. Everyone could register via his/her Twitter account and could then add articles from PubMed via the DOI or PubMed ID. Registered users could also link their account to their Open Researcher & Contributor ID ([ORCID](http://orcid.org)) account, the articles listed in the ORCID profile would then be automatically imported into their ScienceCard profile.

The project [started](http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/09/28/announcing-sciencecard/) at the hackathon of the 2011 Science Online London Conference, and [was a finalist](http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/11/20/sciencecard-named-finalist-in-mendeleyplos-api-binary-battle/) in the PLOS/Mendeley API Binary Battle. I am sure ScienceCard was a factor in PLOS [hiring me as the technical lead for their Article-Level Metrics project](http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2012/04/23/plos-article-level-metrics-interview-with-martin-fenner/) in April 2012, as ScienceCard is a fork of the PLOS ALM software.

With the shifted focus I had to reconsider what to do with ScienceCard. Writing the software is not the difficult part, collecting Article-Level Metrics is, and it is not something you can do in a side project a few hours a week. Although I still see value in an Article-Level Metrics service that focuses on researchers (rather than publishers or institutions), this is a difficult business, and not something I'm currently interested in pursuing full-time. I have therefore discontinued the ScienceCard service.

Some useful services that collect Article-Level Metrics that you can use instead include:

* [PLOS Article-Level Metrics](http://article-level-metrics.plos.org/)
* [ImpactStory](http://impactstory.org)
* [Altmetric](http://altmetric.com)
* [Plum Analytics](http://www.plumanalytics.com/)

This is not the end of ScienceCard, as I have some cool ideas on how to relaunch the service. The concept will be different, but the focus will still be on pages showing the research impact of individual researchers. Stay tuned and expect a relaunch in October.
